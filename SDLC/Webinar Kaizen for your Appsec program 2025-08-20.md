#### 5S principle
15 minutes each day, before starting work
Only allowed to do one of these 5 activities:
- **Sort (Seiri):** Identify and remove all unnecessary items from the workspace.
- **Set in Order (Seiton):** Arrange all necessary items in a logical and accessible manner.
- **Shine (Seiso):** Clean the workspace and equipment, and integrate cleaning into daily routines.
- **Standardize (Seiketsu):** Create procedures and standards to ensure the first three S's are maintained consistently.    
- **Sustain (Shitsuke):** Make 5S a habit and a core part of the workplace culture.

**Iterations can live by themselves on a stream** ****
No need to do full 90 question questionnaire again, only the bits for that stream!

**More empirical data than just the assessment is needed!**
- it shows that security is actually improving
- bottom-up metrics needed -> ASPM (Defectdojo)
