Next time: revisit supply chain?
-  automation 

Security by design
-> check our whitepaper against the definition in the annex of the CRA
-> Requirements in annex I under requirement 2 -> most are mentioned, the rest is implicitly assumed.

Work is ongoing to adapt EUCC to work for CRA conformity assessment
- Resolve EUCC gaps identified -> see slides Arnaud of 01/07

### Art 13: due diligence when integrating components
- see slide 17 on what due diligence means
- this includes open source components

CRA standardization - slide 24
- WG9 PT1 principles for cyber resilience -> delayed until 30/9
- PT2 -> deadline EoY


## Presentation on Vulnerability management
Benjamin Carlier (Daikin)

#### People

- Security analyst role -> see EU skills framework definiton
- See division of roles in Daikin

#### Processes
- Decision tree for open source -> are you manufacturer
- CIS controls on vuln mgmt

**Look at vulnerability orchestration example of Daikin**

Issues with MPVD -> see comm overhead example from Daikin!

Exposing security advisories online -> Look at SImenes PSIRT -> highly regarded by Benj

CSAF -> automated monitoring of vulnerabilities in supply chain

#### Use of AI
-> check changelogs of open source projects and asking if there is anything security relevant in there works really well (low noise - high signal)
-> they use VS code with extensions to flag issues while using Copilot driven development

## Scalable vulnerability management
CPE is too much hassle -> Siemens does not participate

VEX expresses is a vulnerability is exploitable in your context -> status of investigation is also captured

Steampipe for cloud scans

https://www.securecodebox.io/ for vulnerability scanning

https://megalinter.io/latest/ combines a lot of linters, secrets scanning etc in 1 tools, can upload to defectdojo


#### Categories of vulnerabilities
1. basic vuln
2. Exploitable -> Fix ASAP
3. **actively exploited vuln -> include this separately in incident management procedure as this requires notifying the national CERT** 
	1. Reporiting obligations applicable as of 11/09/2026 -> Needs to be added in 2026 policies

## Organizational practices
